# Pookalam to Poovu
The web app allows you to upload the design of your pookkalam and tells you what all flowers you'll need.
Using Flask and OpenCV, the colours in the uploaded image are detected and the corresponding flowers and their images are displayed on the screen. (The images are displayed on hovering over the name of the flower).
Happy Onam!
